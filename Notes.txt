1.Single Inheritance:-
class Parent:
	methods/attributes
	
class Child(Parent):
	methods/attributes
	
obj = Child()

2.Multiple Inheritance:-
class A:
	methods/attributes
	
class B:
	methods/attributes

class C(A,B):
	methods/attributes
	
obj = C()
	
3.Multilevel Inheritance:-
class A:
	methods/attributes

class B(A):
	methods/attributes

class C(B):
	methods/attributes

obj = C()

4.Hierarchical Inheritance:-
class Parent:
	methods/attributes

class Child1(Parent):
	methods/attributes

class Child2(Parent):
	methods/attributes

obj1 = Child1()
obj2 = Child2()

5.Hybrid Inheritance:-
class A:
	methods/attributes
	
class B(A):
	methods/attributes

class C:
	methods/attributes
	
class D(B,C):
	methods/attributes
	
obj = D()

Method Overriding:-
class Parent:
	def greet(self):
		print("Hello everyone")
		
class Child(Parent):
	def greet(self): #Method overriding
		print("Good Morning everyone")
		

Encapsulation-
1.Public Members:- It is accessible anywhere
class Student:
	def __init__(self, name):
		self.name = name #Public
	
s1 = Student("Allen")
print(s1.name)

2.Protected Members(_):- accessible inside the class also inside the child class.
-It is not recommended to use.

class Student:
	def __init__(self, name):
		self._name = name #Protected
	
s1 = Student("Allen")
print(s1._name)# Possible but not recommended

3.Private Members(__):- accessible only inside the class.
-If we try to access private members outside the class then it will throws an error.

class Student:
	def __init__(self, name):
		self.__name = name #Private
	
s1 = Student("Allen")
print(s1.__name)# Not-possible , throws an error

Polymorphism:-
1. Method Overriding(Runtime Polymorphism):-
2. Polymorphism with Different Objects:-
class Bird:
	def fly(self):
		print("Bird can fly")
		
class Airplane:
	def fly(self):
		print("Airplane flies in sky")
	
b1 = Bird()
b1.fly()
ar1 = Airplane()
ar1.fly()

Abstraction:-
ABC(Abstract Base Class) and abstractmethod

from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
class Vehicle(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def start_engine(self):
        pass

class Car(Vehicle):
    def start_engine(self):
        print("Car engine started")

class Bike(Vehicle):
    def start_engine(self):
        print("Bike engine started")

car1 = Car()
car1.start_engine()
bike1 = Bike()
bike1.start_engine()

Exception Handling:-

try:
	statement
except:
	statement
finally:
	statement
	
File Handling:-
open()

file = open('fileName', 'mode')

Some Common File Handling Modes:-
r(read mode)-It allows to open a file for read only, 
w(write mode)- It allows to open a file for writting only, 
a(append mode)- 
r+(Read and write)- 
w+(Write and read)- 
a+(Append and read)- 

File reading methods():-
1. read()- It reads the entire file as a string.
2. readline()- It reads the one line at a time as a string.
- It accepts an argument that is index value, according to the index value it will read the file.
3. readlines()- I t reads all the lines.

File closing Method:-
close()	with

syntax- 1
file = open('fileName', 'mode')
content = file.read()
file.close()

syntax- 2
with open('fileName', 'mode') as f:
	content = f.read()
	print(content)
	
Some additional Methods for File Handling:-
1. seek()-It moves the file pointer to specific position/index.
2. writable()-It checks if the file is writable or not.
3. readable()-It checks if the file is readable or not.

Modules:- 
Syntax-1
import module_name

Syntax-2
from module_name import method/class

Syntax-3
from module_name import method1, method2, ..

Syntax-4(not recommended)
from module_name import * 

Multi-Threading:- threading

Multi-Processing:- multiprocessing

python -m notebook
pip install jupyter

zip()-
dtype - int32, int54, float64, etc
size - 
itemSize - 
shape - e.g- (2,3)

Array Creation and basic manipulation Methods:-
1. array()
2. zeros()
3. ones()
4. empty()
5. arange(start, end , steps)
6. reshape(row, col)
7. linspace()	
8. min() and max()
9. sum()
10. sqrt()
11. dot()
12. power()
13. ravel()
